#### Comments

Some classes are suffixed with 'DTO' for semantics to be clearer, but perhaps others have 'Model'

### Dependencies and How to use

You will need a [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/), [Loggly](https://www.loggly.com/) and [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/) KEYS for use all API; :metal: 

1. `git clone https://github.com/queirozdaniel/food-delivery.git`
2. Configure `Variable Keys`
3. Happy coding ðŸŽ‰ðŸ™Œ
